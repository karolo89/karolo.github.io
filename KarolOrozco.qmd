# Education {background-color="#FFC107"}

As a graduated engineer, I have acquired an extensive experience and problem–solving expertise in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and model development. Since effective communicating of data is of paramount importance, I have subsequently developed strong skills in data visualization and business knowledge. I hold an MBA from Willamette University and currently pursuing a second master in Data Science.
