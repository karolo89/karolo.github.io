# Personal Profile

I help to create and sustain communities, programs, and solutions that enhance the use of responsible data science and business practices for equitable social good.


# Education {background-color="#562457"}

As a graduated engineer, I have acquired an extensive experience and problem–solving expertise in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and model development. Since effective communicating of data is of paramount importance, I have subsequently developed strong skills in data visualization and business knowledge. I hold an MBA from Willamette University and currently pursuing a second master in Data Science.


# Skills

I have experience working on the public and private sector helping organization to embrace Shared Value by positively impacting society and the environment. The sweet spot where profit meets purpose.
