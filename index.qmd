My name is Karol Orozco, I am from Barranquilla, Colombia, a city also known as "la Arenosa" (the Sandy) and "Curramba la Bella" (Curramba the beautiful), is one of Colombia's major cities, as well as a key tourist destination for locals and foreigners. The city, where the long journey of the Magdalena River ends, is home to many great musicians, writers, and painters. It is also the country's most famous celebration stage: the [Carnival of Barranquilla](https://carnavaldebarranquilla.org/).

As a graduated engineer, I have acquired extensive experience and problem–solving expertise in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and model development. Since effective communication of data is of paramount importance, I have subsequently developed strong skills in data visualization and business knowledge. I hold an MBA from Willamette University and currently pursuing a second master's in Data Science.

I have experience working on the public and private sector helping organization to embrace Shared Value by positively impacting society and the environment: The sweet spot where profit meets purpose.
