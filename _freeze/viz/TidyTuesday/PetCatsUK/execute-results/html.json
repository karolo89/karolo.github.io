I must admit that dogs are my favorite pets, but many of my friends love cats, and I always hear stories about how independent their pets are, which made me want to learn more about them.\n\nWell, I was born in Colombia, and during my time there, I always remember the cats running and fighting on my roof, which would keep me up at night for a few hours. Then, a few weeks later, I heard tiny meows and noticed the presence of some kittens, which made me suspect that it was another kind of fun that was going on there.\n\nAccording to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ASPCA, a female cat can have an average of four to six kittens per litter and may have one to two litters per year. Some cat owners prefer to spay or neuter their cats.\n\nThe TidyTuesday, weekly data project, posted on January 31st, 2023, a dataset from the Movebank for Animal Tracking Data, which includes cats' characteristics (such as age, sex, neuter status, hunting habits) and time-stamped GPS pings.  I'll take a look at the reproductive status of the cats and provide an alternate viewing option to the one offered by the Twitter user [@OluwafemOyedele](https://twitter.com/OluwafemOyedele/status/1621817963232874496/photo/1).\n\nYou can find the data on the TidyTuesday Github site- [\"Pet Cats UK\"](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-01-31/readme.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Reference\n\nKays R, Dunn RR, Parsons AW, Mcdonald B, Perkins T, Powers S, Shell L, McDonald JL, Cole H, Kikillus H, Woods L, Tindle H, Roetman P (2020) The small home ranges and large local ecological impacts of pet cats.
