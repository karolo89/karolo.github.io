(Definition developed at the 1998 IACP Summit on Hate Crime in America.) This data exploration aims to learn about the most common locations where these crimes occurred and the type of assault received by the victims.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n Bias.Category       Bias.Type         Business.as.victim  Case.Type        \n Length:862         Length:862         Length:862         Length:862        \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n Location.Type      Open.Data.Case.Number Primary.Offense.Type\n Length:862         Length:862            Length:862          \n Class :character   Class :character      Class :character    \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character      Mode  :character    \n                                                              \n                                                              \n                                                              \n                                                              \n Report.Month.Year     Suspect.Age     Suspect.Gender     Suspect.Race      \n Min.   :2015-04-01   Min.   : 11.00   Length:862         Length:862        \n 1st Qu.:2018-07-01   1st Qu.: 30.00   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :2020-03-01   Median : 40.00   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :2019-11-14   Mean   : 41.51                                        \n 3rd Qu.:2021-08-01   3rd Qu.: 50.50                                        \n Max.   :2022-09-01   Max.   :101.00                                        \n                      NA's   :511                                           \n   Victim.Age    Victim.Gender      Victim.Race       \n Min.   : 2.00   Length:862         Length:862        \n 1st Qu.:23.00   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :32.00   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :35.61                                        \n 3rd Qu.:46.00                                        \n Max.   :83.00                                        \n NA's   :415                                          \n Victim.Suspect.Relationship      year     \n Length:862                  Min.   :2015  \n Class :character            1st Qu.:2018  \n Mode  :character            Median :2020  \n                             Mean   :2019  \n                             3rd Qu.:2021  \n                             Max.   :2022  \n                                           \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInsights:\n\n\n- The victims are from 2 to 83 years old, with a median of 32 (when the information was available)\n- The ages of the suspects are from 11 to over 80 years, with a median of 40 (when the information was available)\n- Most hate crimes were reported in 2021, with a decline in 2022, but bias incidents have increased over the past two years.\n- Over the past five years, the most common motivations for bias have been race, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.\n- The most common cases of bias reported have been against Black or African-American people, followed by Anti-Gay (Male) and Anti-White.\n- The places where these incidents occurred the most are Public Spaces (Streets/Roads/Sidewalks), residences, and Parking Lots.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](biascrime_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](biascrime_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](biascrime_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](biascrime_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n",
