### Background

As a highly motivated and results-oriented professional, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and interpersonal skills to the table. I am committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in all aspects of my life, and I believe that a diverse and inclusive workplace leads to better outcomes for employees, the company as a whole, and our community.

My experience has also taught me how to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to identify business needs and translate them into data-driven solutions. I have a keen eye for detail, am skilled in data visualization tools and techniques, and have a proven track record of communicating complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
